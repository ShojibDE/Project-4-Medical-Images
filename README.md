# Project-4-Medical-Images
Classify chest disease 
# Overview 
This is a  image classification  trained Machine Learning Model on the top of Keras API.Model takes four types of image Healthy, Covid-19, Bacterial Pneumonia , Viral Pnemonia. Model use Convolutinal Neural Network Architecture, with the help of a pretraied model ResNet50 for applying Transfer Learning technique
